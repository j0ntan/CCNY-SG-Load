# CCNY Smart Grid Load

The Smart Grid Load is a resistive, variable load component of the smart grid testbed at Smart Grid Lab in the City College of New York. This repository implements a control system to that allows:

1. Setting the value of 3-phase AC loading to a balanced or unbalanced state.
2. Varying the amount of loading for a DC source.
3. Automating the amount of loading over time according to a load profile.

For further details on working with this repository & running the Arduino driver sketch, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/j0ntan/CCNY-SG-Load/docs/wiki) documentation.
